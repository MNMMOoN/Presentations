# Presentations

This repository hosts a curated collection of my academic and professional presentations, showcasing my research in **neuroscience**, **dynamical systems**, **optimization**, **numerical methods**, and **philosophy of mathematics**. These works reflect my interdisciplinary approach, blending mathematical rigor with practical applications. I invite researchers, educators, and enthusiasts to explore these materials and engage with the ideas presented.

## Presentations

### Neuroscience
- **[A Handful of Mathematical Models in Neuroscience (May 2025)](https://github.com/MNMMOoN/Presentations/blob/main/neuroscience/hh_model.pdf)**  
  Explores mathematical models for understanding neural systems: 
  - Hodgkin–Huxley Model 
  - Integrate-and-Fire Models 
  - FitzHugh–Nagumo Model
- **[Brain Vision System (Dec 2024)](https://github.com/MNMMOoN/Presentations/blob/main/neuroscience/brain_vision_system.pdf)**  
  Discusses visual pathways and our vision network.
- **[Multidimensional Cerebellar Computations for Flexible Kinematic Control of Movements (Jan 2024)](https://github.com/MNMMOoN/Presentations/blob/main/neuroscience/cerebellar_computations.pdf)**  
  Examines cerebellar models for motor control, emphasizing multidimensional computations for monkey eye movements.

### Dynamical Systems
- **[The Quantities of Chaos (July 2024)](https://github.com/MNMMOoN/Presentations/blob/main/dynamical_systems/chaos_theory.pdf)**  
  My master’s defense presentation, analyzing chaotic dynamics through measures like Lyapunov exponents and entropy.
- **[The Fundamental Theorem of Dynamical Systems (May 2024)](https://github.com/MNMMOoN/Presentations/blob/main/dynamical_systems/conley_theorem.pdf)**  
  Covers the fundamental theorem in dynamical systems.

### Optimization
- **[On the Global Convergence of Randomized Coordinate Gradient Descent for Nonconvex Optimization (Jan 2024)](https://github.com/MNMMOoN/Presentations/blob/main/dynamical_systems/global_convergence_gradient_descent.pdf)**  
  Explain convergence properties of randomized coordinate gradient descent in nonconvex optimization.

### Numerical Methods
- **[NDE: Runge-Kutta Methods (Nov 2021)](https://github.com/MNMMOoN/Presentations/blob/main/others/runge_kutta_method.pdf)**  
  Introduces Runge-Kutta methods for solving differential equations, detailing their derivation and applications.

### Philosophy of Mathematics
- **[Philosophy of Mathematics: Historical, Mathematical, and Philosophical Events (Oct 2021)](https://github.com/MNMMOoN/Presentations/blob/main/others/philosophical_examples.pdf)**  
  Traces the historical and philosophical evolution of mathematical thought and its key events. Some examples of philosophycal events evolutionalize mathematics and vice versa.
